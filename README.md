# React-Portfolio

I based this portfolio off of my original design, made a few changes to update the UI and functionality. Due to personal 
life time issues, I didn't truly get to do what I wanted with the CSS so that would be the one thing I's add to future development
just to style the website to a more modern look and less text.

I commented most parts out unlike past projects because it really is a hard habit to create but I managed with this project at the very least.

Here is a picture of the original portfolio and a ![LINK](https://anlubelni.github.io/React-ALBNPortfolio/) to the new one to see just how much and also how little it has changed!
