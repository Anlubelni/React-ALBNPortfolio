                My name is Ana Belmontes and I am a Jr Full Stack Web developer. 
            Although I love coding and front-end has a special place in my heart, my true strength 
            lies in project management. This is due to my previous experience in the field of Law with an 
            emphasis on ADR as well as my professional background of 10 years in the customer service 
            industry and strong team work based environments.
