                My name is Ana Belmontes and I am a Jr Full Stack Web developer. 
            Although I love coding and front-end developing has a special place in my heart, my true strength 
            lies in project management. Thus is due to my previous experience in the field of Law with an 
            emphasis on ADR as well as the previous jobs I've held, all of which are in the customer service area and 
            have strong ties to team work.
